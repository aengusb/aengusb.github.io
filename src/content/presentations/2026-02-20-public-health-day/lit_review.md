## Section I: The Metaphor — What Does a "Healthy" Information Ecosystem Look Like?

### Krause, Freiling & Scheufele (2025) — "Our changing information ecosystem for science and why it matters for effective science communication"
**Venue:** PNAS | **Citations:** ~15 (very recent)

- The information ecosystem for science has fundamentally changed: fragmented, platformized, algorithmically curated
- Traditional "deficit model" (just give people more facts) doesn't work in this new ecosystem
- Need ecosystem-level thinking: it's not about individual pieces of misinformation but the structural conditions that allow it to thrive
- Science communication must adapt to an environment where trust, attention, and authority are distributed differently

**Key quote for talk:** The problem isn't just bad content — it's the structural conditions of the ecosystem that amplify it.

---

### Introne, McKernan & Corsbie-Massay (2024) — "Healthier information ecosystems: A definition and agenda"
**Venue:** JASIST

- Provides a formal **definition of information ecosystem health** — directly relevant to talk framing
- Draws parallel between biological ecosystems and information ecosystems: diversity, resilience, flow
- Healthy information ecosystems have: diverse sources, functional feedback loops, resilience to shocks, capacity for self-correction
- Unhealthy ecosystems show: monocultures of information, broken feedback loops, vulnerability to manipulation

**Key quote for talk:** Provides the theoretical foundation for the ecosystem health metaphor.

---

### Allen, Howland, Mobius et al. (2020) — "Evaluating the fake news problem at the scale of the information ecosystem"
**Venue:** Science Advances | **Citations:** 407

- Fake news consumption is real but represents a **small fraction** of overall news consumption (~1% of media diet)
- The problem is concentrated: a small number of heavy consumers account for most fake news exposure
- **Ecosystem framing**: fake news is a symptom of broader information diet patterns, not the whole disease
- Mainstream media still dominates information consumption even in polarized environments

**Key stat for talk:** Fake news = ~1% of media diet, but concentrated among heavy consumers. The ecosystem matters more than individual pieces of content.

---

### Benkler, Faris & Roberts (2018) — *Network Propaganda*
**Venue:** Oxford University Press | **Citations:** 750+

- The US media ecosystem is **asymmetrically polarized**: right-wing media operates as a self-reinforcing network disconnected from mainstream media norms
- This is an **ecosystem-level** problem, not just a content problem — the architecture creates conditions for misinformation
- Platform design, economic incentives, and media structure all contribute
- The left and center remain anchored to mainstream journalism; the right has built an alternative ecosystem

**Key insight for talk:** Ecosystem disease is structural, not just about individual bad actors or pieces of content.

---

### Tokita, Guess & Tarnita (2021) — "Polarized information ecosystems can reorganize social networks via information cascades"
**Venue:** PNAS | **Citations:** ~56

- Formal model showing how **polarized information ecosystems reshape social networks** — not just the other way around
- Information cascades can cause network reorganization even when individuals have moderate views
- The ecosystem structure (what information flows where) actively shapes community structure
- Demonstrates feedback loop: ecosystem → network structure → ecosystem

**Key insight for talk:** The ecosystem and the social structure co-evolve — unhealthy information environments create unhealthy social structures.

---

### Bridgman, Davla & Park (2025) — "Like it or Not: The Changing Canadian Information Ecosystem"
**Your own work**

- Tracks changes in the Canadian information ecosystem
- Documents the shift toward platform-mediated news consumption
- Canadian-specific data on information ecosystem health
- Bridges the general ecosystem literature to the Canadian context your audience inhabits

---

### Bridgman, Merkley & Zhilin (2021) — "Infodemic Pathways: Evaluating the Role That Traditional and Social Media Play in Cross-National Information Spread"
**Venue:** Frontiers in Political Science

- Maps how misinformation travels across media types (social → traditional and vice versa)
- The "infodemic" concept: information epidemics that parallel disease epidemics
- Cross-national analysis showing different pathways in different media ecosystems
- Direct bridge between the epidemiological framing and information ecosystem health

**Key insight for talk:** The infodemic metaphor is not just metaphor — information spread follows epidemiological patterns.

---

## Section II: Health Misinformation as Symptom

### Southwell, Machuca & Cherry (2022/2023) — "Health Misinformation Exposure and Health Disparities"
**Venue:** Annual Review of Public Health | **Citations:** 65

- **Health misinformation exposure is not equally distributed** — it follows existing health disparities
- Those with lower health literacy, lower socioeconomic status, and racial/ethnic minorities are more exposed AND more affected
- Health misinformation is a **health equity issue**, not just a media issue
- Exacerbates existing disparities in health outcomes

**Key stat for talk:** Health misinformation disproportionately harms already-vulnerable populations. It's a health equity issue.

---

### Loomba, de Figueiredo & Piatek et al. (2021) — "Measuring the impact of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on vaccination intent in the UK and USA"
**Venue:** Nature Human Behaviour | **Citations:** ~200+

- Exposure to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation **reduced vaccination intent by 6.2 percentage points** (UK) and **6.4 points** (US)
- Even brief exposure to misinformation had measurable effects on intentions
- Effects varied by demographic group — larger effects among those already hesitant
- Demonstrates **causal pathway** from misinformation exposure to health behavior

**Key stat for talk:** A single exposure to vaccine misinformation reduced vaccination intent by ~6 percentage points.

---

### Broniatowski, Simons & Gu (2023) — "The efficacy of Facebook's vaccine misinformation policies and architecture during the COVID-19 pandemic"
**Venue:** Science Advances

- Facebook's vaccine misinformation policies were **largely ineffective**
- Anti-vaccine content continued to circulate despite policies
- Platform architecture (groups, algorithmic amplification) undermined content moderation
- Demonstrates the gap between platform promises and actual ecosystem effects

**Key insight for talk:** Platform self-regulation has failed — content moderation alone doesn't fix ecosystem disease.

---

### Borges do Nascimento, Pizarro & Almeida (2022) — "Infodemics and health misinformation: a systematic review of reviews"
**Venue:** Bulletin of the World Health Organization | **Citations:** 276

- Meta-review synthesizing evidence across multiple systematic reviews
- **WHO-endorsed framework** for understanding infodemics
- Health misinformation spreads faster and wider than accurate health information
- Identifies key vectors: social media platforms, messaging apps, and increasingly podcasts/video

**Key stat for talk:** WHO-level evidence synthesis confirming the infodemic as a parallel pandemic.

---

### Scherer & Pennycook (2020) — "Who Is Susceptible to Online Health Misinformation?"
**Venue:** American Journal of Public Health

- Susceptibility to health misinformation predicted by **analytic thinking style** (not just political ideology)
- Those who engage in more reflective thinking are better at distinguishing true from false health claims
- Health literacy and digital literacy both protective
- Not just a "misinformed people" problem — it's about cognitive engagement with information

**Key insight for talk:** Susceptibility is about thinking style, not intelligence — interventions that promote reflection can help.

---

### Roozenbeek et al. (2020) — "Susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19 around the world"
**Venue:** Royal Society Open Science | **Citations:** 1,087

- Large cross-national study (N > 20,000 across multiple countries)
- Trust in scientists was the **strongest protective factor** against COVID-19 misinformation belief
- Reliance on social media for news = higher susceptibility; reliance on traditional media = lower
- Numeracy and education also protective, but trust in science was dominant

**Key stat for talk:** Trust in scientists was the #1 predictor of resistance to COVID misinformation across countries.

---

## Section III: The Treatment — What Works

### Kozyreva et al. (2024) — "Toolbox of individual-level interventions against online misinformation"
**Venue:** Nature Human Behaviour | **Citations:** 115

- **Comprehensive taxonomy of interventions**: prebunking, debunking, accuracy nudges, media literacy, lateral reading, credibility labels
- **Prebunking** (inoculation) shows strongest and most durable effects
- **Accuracy nudges** (simply asking "is this accurate?") shift attention to accuracy and reduce sharing
- **No single intervention is sufficient** — need combination approaches
- Individual-level interventions must be complemented by structural/platform-level changes

**Key framework for talk:** The "toolbox" metaphor — no silver bullet, need multiple tools working together.

---

### Lewandowsky & van der Linden (2021) — "Countering Misinformation and Fake News Through Inoculation and Prebunking"
**Venue:** European Review of Social Psychology

- **Inoculation theory**: exposing people to weakened forms of misinformation builds resistance (like a vaccine!)
- Prebunking is more effective than debunking — prevention > cure
- Effects are durable (weeks to months) and can be scaled via social media
- The vaccine metaphor is literal: psychological inoculation works like biological inoculation

**Key insight for talk:** The perfect metaphor for your public health audience — inoculation against misinformation works just like inoculation against disease.

---

### Bak-Coleman et al. (2022) — "Combining interventions to reduce the spread of viral misinformation"
**Venue:** Nature Human Behaviour | **Citations:** 127

- Tests **combinations** of interventions (accuracy nudges + credibility labels + friction)
- Combined interventions reduce misinformation sharing by **~50-70%** more than any single intervention
- No single intervention is sufficient alone
- Platform-level and individual-level interventions are complementary

**Key stat for talk:** Combining interventions is 50-70% more effective than any single approach.

---

### Walter, Cohen & Holbert (2020) — "Fact-Checking: A Meta-Analysis of What Works and for Whom"
**Venue:** Political Communication

- Meta-analysis of fact-checking effectiveness across studies
- Fact-checking **does reduce misperceptions** (moderate effect size)
- More effective when corrections come from credible sources
- Less effective when misinformation is politically congenial
- Visual corrections (infographics) more effective than text-only

**Key stat for talk:** Fact-checking works, but effectiveness depends on source credibility and presentation format.

---

### Walter, Brooks & Saucier (2020) — "Evaluating the Impact of Attempts to Correct Health Misinformation on Social Media: A Meta-Analysis"
**Venue:** Health Communication | **Citations:** 273

- **Health-specific** meta-analysis of correction attempts on social media
- Corrections are effective at reducing misperceptions (d = 0.40)
- **Source matters**: corrections from health authorities more effective than from peers
- Corrections work better for **factual claims** than for **risk perceptions**
- Visual corrections outperform text-only corrections

**Key stats for talk:** Corrections work (d = 0.40), but health authority sources and visual formats are most effective.

---

### Vivion et al. (2022) — "Prebunking messaging to inoculate against COVID-19 vaccine misinformation"
**Venue:** Journal of Communication in Healthcare

- Tests prebunking specifically for **COVID-19 vaccine misinformation**
- Prebunking messages increased ability to identify vaccine misinformation
- Effects strongest when prebunking targeted **manipulation techniques** rather than specific claims
- Directly relevant to public health communication strategy

**Key insight for talk:** Teach people to spot manipulation techniques, not just correct specific myths.

---

### Carey, Guess & Loewen (2022) — "The ephemeral effects of fact-checks on COVID-19 misperceptions"
**Venue:** Nature Human Behaviour

- Fact-checks reduce misperceptions **immediately** but effects decay within days
- Study across US, UK, and Canada
- **The "treatment" needs to be ongoing**, not one-time — again like medicine
- Highlights the challenge: you can't just fact-check once and be done

**Key insight for talk:** Like chronic disease management — ongoing treatment needed, not one-time intervention.

---

### Bode & Vraga (2018) — "See Something, Say Something: Correction of Global Health Misinformation on Social Media"
**Venue:** Health Communication

- User-generated corrections on social media can be effective
- When peers correct health misinformation, it reduces misperceptions
- Suggests empowering health researchers to be active correctors on social media
- **Direct recommendation for audience**: your voice matters in the ecosystem

**Key insight for talk:** Health researchers can be part of the treatment — their expert voice on social media matters.

## Synthesis: Key Themes for the Keynote

### The Ecosystem Metaphor Holds Up
- Information ecosystems have measurable properties: diversity, resilience, feedback loops
- Unhealthy ecosystems produce misinformation as a symptom, not just as random noise
- The structure matters more than individual pieces of content

### Health Misinformation = Health Equity Issue
- Disproportionately affects vulnerable populations
- Measurable causal effects on health behaviors (6pp drop in vaccine intent)
- Platform self-regulation has failed to address it

### The Treatment Must Be Multi-Level
1. **Individual**: Prebunking/inoculation (the vaccine metaphor!), media literacy, accuracy nudges
2. **Platform**: Combination interventions, friction, credibility signals
3. **Systemic**: Trust in science, expert engagement, ecosystem design
4. **Ongoing**: Effects are ephemeral — need sustained intervention like chronic disease management

### Perfect Framing for Public Health Audience
- **Diagnosis** → Information ecosystem disease (structural, not just content)
- **Epidemiology** → Who is affected, how it spreads, risk factors
- **Treatment** → Multi-modal, combination therapy, prevention > cure
- **Inoculation** → Literally the same concept applied to information
- **Public health role** → Health researchers as ecosystem participants, not just observers
