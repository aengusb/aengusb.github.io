Welcome to my personal-professional website. I am an Assitant Professor (Research) at McGill University. I study political behaviour and communication in Canada and other mature democracies. Methodologically, I work with survey, census, and social/traditional media data with an additional interest in data science, machine learning, natural language processing and computational social science more generally. My work has been published or is forthcoming in *The Journal of Politics*, *The Journal of Experimental Political Science*, *Party Politics*, *The Misinformation Review*, *Frontiers in Political Science*, and *The Canadian Journal of Political Science*.

I direct the [Media Ecosystem Observatory](https://www.mediaecosystemobservatory.com/) and am affiliated with the [Centre for Media Technology and Democracy](https://www.mediatechdemocracy.com/), the [Max Bell School for Public Policy](https://www.mcgill.ca/maxbellschool/), and NYU's [Centre for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/).

I grew up on the prairies in Winnipeg, Manitoba and miss the urban forest and magical prairie sky. In my spare time you can find me cycling, enjoying a game of spikeball in one of Montreal's many beautiful parks, or fighting the lords of the underworld as Tarkin the Paladin.
