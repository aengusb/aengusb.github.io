Welcome to my personal-professional website. I am a PhD Candidate at McGill University and sometimes management consultant. My work focuses on participatory and deliberative democracy, local government, and more generally on mass participation in civic and political life. I study these phenomena in Canada and other mature democracies. Methodologically, I work with survey, census, and textual data and have a secondary interest in machine learning, natural language processing and computational social science more generally. 

I am currently a research fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship which is a multi-university research center that seeks to better understand the relationship between citizens and political processes. My research is funded by the Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council, from whom I hold a Joseph-Armand Bombardier Scholarship. I am thankful for SSRHC, the CSDC, and McGill -- I am fortunate to have such an amazing job.

While I was born in Toronto, I grew up on the praries in Winnipeg, Manitoba and miss the urban forest and magical prairie sky. In my spare time you can find me cycling, enjoying a game of spikeball in one of Montreal's many beautiful parks, or fighting the lords of the underworld as Tarkin the Paladin with "the guys" from elementary school.
