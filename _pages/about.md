Welcome to my personal-professional website. I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at McGill University. I study political behaviour and particularly participation and motivation of online political activists. I study these phenomena in Canada and other mature democracies. Methodologically, I work with survey, census, and social media data with an additional interest in data science, machine learning, natural language processing and computational social science more generally. My work has been published or is forthcoming in  *The Journal of Politics*, *Party Politics*, and *Canadian Journal of Political Science*.

I am currently a research fellow at the [Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/) which is a multi-university research center that seeks to better understand the relationship between citizens and political processes. I worked with the [Digital Democracy Project](https://ppforum.ca/project/ddp/) and am now a core part of the newly launched [Media Ecosystem Observatory](https://www.mediaecosystemobservatory.com/). I am also affiliated with the [Max Bell School for Public Policy](https://www.mcgill.ca/maxbellschool/) and the [Network Dynamics Lab](http://networkdynamics.org/).

My research is funded by the Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council, from whom I hold a Joseph-Armand Bombardier Scholarship. I am thankful for SSRHC, the CSDC, NDL, DDP, MEO, and McGill -- I am fortunate to have such an amazing job.

I grew up on the prairies in Winnipeg, Manitoba and miss the urban forest and magical prairie sky. In my spare time you can find me cycling, enjoying a game of spikeball in one of Montreal's many beautiful parks, or fighting the lords of the underworld as Tarkin the Paladin.
