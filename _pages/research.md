Strong evidence exists that major campaign-relevant events can have substantial impacts on vote intentions. We know less about how information about such events diffuses and why only some events become salient. We posit that voters often become aware of such exogenous events via a media mechanism. As the salience of the policy issue in the media increases, we argue that, under certain conditions, the media primes the voters to defect from their party and its leader. We investigate these processes by studying an unexpected court ruling during the 2015 Canadian federal election campaign. Based on difference-in-differences and text-as-data approaches, we find that an exogenous court ruling related to immigrant integration led to between a 5 and 11 percentage point decline in the leading party’s support. Beyond modeling how campaign-relevant events become salient through the media, we provide evidence about circumstances where leaders should not expect party loyalty to override crystallized opinions.

Measuring relative legislative influence is notoriously difficult, particularly in bicameral systems where two chambers have similar formal powers. Recent changes to the Canadian legislature offer a unique opportunity to understand how an upper house liberated from party constraints impacts that houses’ legislative influence. I leverage an original panel data set matching lobbyist activity to parliamentarian characteristics and responsibilities and, using a difference-in-differences design, compare Members of Parliament to Senators, both independent and partisan. I find that independent Senators receive disproportionately more attention from lobbyists both after the changes and as the independent composition of the Senate grows. This article offers a time-variant measure by which perceived influence can be evaluated and contributes to the extant literature on intercameral relationships, partisanship, the legislative process, and party discipline and cohesion.

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed nearly unprecedented pressure on policymakers and citizens alike. Effectively containing the pandemic requires a societal consensus. However, a long line of research in political science has told us that polarization tends to occur on highly salient topics because partisans “follow the leader.” We examine the degree of partisan consensus that exists in Canada at the level of political elites and the mass public. We analyze Member of Parliament (MP) Twitter behaviour and show a massive increase in attention to COVID-19 and find no evidence of any MPs from any party downplaying the pandemic. We find no association between Conservative Party vote share and Google search interest in the coronavirus, while survey data show that individual-level partisan differences are small and disappear when controlling for demographics and left-right ideology. Elite and public response to the COVID-19 pandemic can be characterized as a cross-partisan consensus.
